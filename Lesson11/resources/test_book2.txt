This is a different test text created to verify the functionality of the program.
The program should be able to parse the given input and determine the most common words, excluding those with fewer than three characters.
It must operate with high efficiency, ensuring that even large volumes of data are processed quickly without any malfunctions or lags.
The objective is to test the accuracy of the word frequency count and make sure the program can handle different linguistic patterns and sentence structures.
Additionally, the program should manage cases with numbers, symbols, and other non-alphabetic characters correctly, ensuring they do not skew the results.
Test, evaluate, optimize â€“ analyze, adjust, and enhance!
